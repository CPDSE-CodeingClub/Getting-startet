you have installed your IDE and it all seams kind of scary. what is all of this? you might never even have conceded how a program is written. that is what this article is about...
a program is written (mostly) sequentially, meaning one line execute then on to the next line.

looking at this code here:

<code>tekst = "hello world"
print (tekst)</code>
<b>output:</b> hello world


where as this code:

<code>print (tekst)
tekst = "hello world"</code>
<b>output:</b>
NameError: name 'tekst' is not defined

this gives an error... why is that??? 
well the computer dont know yet what the variable "tekst" is therefore it messes up when trying to exceute

<h3>some lines are just ignored by the program</h3>
if the line is blank the program don’t care and just moves on 
you can also make the program ignore a line by inserting a comment

you insert a commet in python by starting the line with #
whatever is afterwards the progam dosent care about and just moves on as nothning was there.

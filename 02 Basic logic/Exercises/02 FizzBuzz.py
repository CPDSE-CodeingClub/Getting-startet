# i have given you a code snippet, that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
#this excercise is more fun if you extend the code for each excercise and dont start over each excercise
# you have only tryly solved the excercise if the code is working reagardless of the numbers printed 
# eg. if the ranges was 200 it still has to work.



# excercise 1
# for multiples of 3, print "fizz" instead of the number, 

# excercise 2
# for multiples of 5, print "buzz". 

# excercise 3
# For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz".

# excercise 4 (HARD)
# do excercise 3 but without the AND operator



for i in range(1, 101):
    #YOUR CODE HERE
